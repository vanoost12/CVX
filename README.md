# CVX
Convex function optimization using CVX
התרגום ארוך מדי לשמירה
Cvx use in order to find the best location for opening a delivery warehouse using Drones.The city is divided into points of demand.
Will find and plot the warhouse place using cvx to solve a convex function mizimization problem.
We were given a function g(x) that shows the average flight time in minutes of the drone from point x to a_i.
We will find the point that minimizes the sum of the drone flight time in order to improve shipping time.
